# Differential-Probe
 Purpose of this project was to design low cost differential probe with attenuations of x10 and x100 
 to measure voltages up to 1kV with bandwidth of atleast 10MHz. Theorethical bandwidth of this probe is estimated at 100MHz
 according to LTSpice. Testing only proved bandwidth of 25MHz as it is limited by Analog Discovery 2 network analyzer max frequency.
